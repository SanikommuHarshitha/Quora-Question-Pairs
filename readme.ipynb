    "**Quora is a place to gain and share knowledge. It's a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers. In this assignment, we are using Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Long Short-Term Memory to identify the duplicates questions. Questions are preprocessed such that the different forms of writing the same thing are tried to be unified such that LSTM does not have to learn different things from these different interpretations.**"

    "**Words which occur more than 100 times in the train set are collected. The rest is considered as rare words and replaced by the word \"memento\". How many of the rare words are common in the both pairs and how many of them are numeric are used as features. This whole process leads to better generalization in LSTM so that it cannot overfit particular pairs by just using these rare words.**\n",

    "**The features mentioned above are merged with NLP and non-NLP features. As a result, 4+15+6=25 features are prepared for the network.**\n",

So, every run uses 1 fold different than the other for training which can contribute to the model variance. Since we are going to ensemble the models, increasing model variance reasonably is something we may want.**\n",

    "**All the features are question order independent. When you swap the first and the second question, the feature matrix does not change. For example, instead of using question1_frequency and question2_frequency, I have used min_frequency and max_frequency.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature values are bounded when necessary. For example, number of neighbors are set to 5 for everything above 5, because I did not want to overfit on a particular pair with specific number of neighbor 76 etc.**\n",
